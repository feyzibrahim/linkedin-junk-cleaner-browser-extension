# LinkedIn Junk Cleaner - Chrome Extension

## ✨ Why Use LinkedIn Junk Cleaner?

LinkedIn's feed can get cluttered with posts liked, commented on, or shared by others, often filling up your feed with unrelated content. This can make it easy to miss important updates from your connections or valuable insights. After waiting for LinkedIn to introduce an option to filter this out, I decided to take things into my own hands — and that's how **LinkedIn Junk Cleaner** was born!

With this extension, you can enjoy a cleaner, more relevant LinkedIn feed, seeing only the posts that matter most.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Cleans Up Your LinkedIn Feed**: Automatically removes posts that are liked, commented on, or shared by others.
-   **Simple On/Off Switch**: Use the toggle switch to enable or disable the cleaner at any time.
-   **Real-Time Cleanup**: Detects and removes unwanted posts as they load on the page.
